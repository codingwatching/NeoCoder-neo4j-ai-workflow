# NeoCoder Coding Workflow System

Welcome to the NeoCoder Coding Workflow System. This incarnation provides structured guidance for AI-assisted coding tasks through action templates and workflow tracking.

## Core Concepts

1. **Action Templates**: Structured workflows for common coding tasks
   - `FIX`: Bug fixing workflow with mandatory testing
   - `REFACTOR`: Code refactoring with safety checks
   - `DEPLOY`: Deployment workflow with verification steps
   - `FEATURE`: New feature implementation
   - `TOOL_ADD`: Adding new tools to the system
   - `CODE_ANALYZE`: Analyzing code structure and quality

2. **Projects**: Organized code repositories with tracking
   - README content stored in Neo4j
   - File structure representation
   - Change history tracking

3. **Workflow Execution**: Audit trail of completed work
   - Only logged after successful test execution
   - Links changes to templates and projects
   - Provides accountability and history

## Getting Started

1. **Get an Action Template**:
   ```
   get_action_template(keyword="FIX")
   ```
   This retrieves the step-by-step workflow for fixing bugs.

2. **Follow the Template Steps**:
   - Each template has specific steps to follow
   - Critical steps (like testing) are mandatory
   - Document changes as you go

3. **Log Successful Completion**:
   ```
   log_workflow_execution(
       project_id="my_project",
       action_keyword="FIX",
       summary="Fixed null pointer exception in user service",
       files_changed=["src/services/user.py"]
   )
   ```
   Only log after all tests pass!

## Available Commands

### Navigation & Guidance
- `get_guidance_hub()` - Return here for orientation
- `suggest_tool(task_description="...")` - Get tool suggestions for a task
- `get_best_practices()` - View coding standards and guidelines

### Action Templates
- `list_action_templates()` - See all available workflows
- `get_action_template(keyword="...")` - Get specific workflow steps
- `add_template_feedback(keyword="...", feedback="...")` - Improve templates

### Project Management
- `list_projects()` - View all projects in the system
- `get_project(project_id="...")` - Get project details and README

### Workflow Tracking
- `log_workflow_execution(...)` - Record completed work (tests must pass!)
- `get_workflow_history(...)` - View past work with filters

### Direct Neo4j Queries
- `run_custom_query(query="...")` - Execute read queries
- `write_neo4j_cypher(query="...")` - Execute write queries

## Best Practices

1. **Always Test Before Logging**: The system enforces quality by requiring test success before logging workflow completion.

2. **Use Templates Consistently**: Templates ensure standardized approaches to common tasks.

3. **Document As You Go**: Include clear summaries and file change lists in workflow logs.

4. **Check History**: Use `get_workflow_history()` to learn from past work.

5. **Provide Feedback**: Help improve templates with `add_template_feedback()`.

## Example Workflow: Fixing a Bug

1. Get the FIX template:
   ```
   get_action_template(keyword="FIX")
   ```

2. Follow the steps:
   - Review the bug report
   - Locate the issue in code
   - Implement the fix
   - **Run all tests** (mandatory!)
   - Update documentation

3. Log the completion:
   ```
   log_workflow_execution(
       project_id="my_app",
       action_keyword="FIX",
       summary="Fixed date parsing error in API endpoint",
       files_changed=["src/api/dates.py", "tests/test_dates.py"]
   )
   ```

Remember: The key to NeoCoder is following structured workflows that ensure quality and maintainability!

4. Review code before deployment
5. Monitor after deployment

## Documentation
1. Keep README files updated
