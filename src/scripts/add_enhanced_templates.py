            "steps": """1. **Phase 1: Core Principles (Why?)**
   - Define the Principle of Inquiry: What core problem does this MVP solve?
   - Establish primary value proposition
   - Align with ethical considerations (harm avoidance, wisdom, integrity, fairness, empathy)

2. **Phase 2: Dimensional Axes (What?)**
   - Intent: Specific purpose (expression, evocation, problem-solving)
   - Method: High-level approaches, techniques, constraints
   - Output: Tangible outcome (visual, textual, experiential)
   - Core Features: Minimum viable feature set prioritized by user need and feasibility
   - Out-of-Scope: Features explicitly excluded from MVP

3. **Phase 3: Recursive Frameworks (How?)**
   - Architectural Design: High-level software architecture (scalability, performance)
   - Technology Stack: Programming languages, frameworks, databases
   - Front-End: UI elements, responsiveness, accessibility
   - Back-End: Server logic, database interactions, integrations
   - Full-Stack Integration: Component integration and testing approach
   - AI/ML Integration: Model types, data requirements, evaluation metrics (if applicable)

4. **Phase 4: Constraints as Catalysts (What if?)**
   - Technical limitations: budget, time, infrastructure
   - Functional limitations: data availability, API restrictions
   - Innovation stimulation: How constraints drive creative solutions

5. **Phase 5: Controlled Emergence (How Else?)**
   - Controlled experimentation areas for novelty/unexpected solutions
   - A/B testing opportunities, algorithm parameter exploration
   - Surprise/novelty control aligned with core purpose

6. **Phase 6: Feedback Loops (What Next?)**
   - Validation strategy: unit, integration, user acceptance testing
   - Anti-hallucination mechanisms and bias detection
   - User feedback collection and integration processes
   - Reflection and re-contextualization mechanisms

7. **Phase 7: Adaptive Flexibility (What Now?)**
   - Future enhancement accommodation and scalability design
   - Meta-level development process adjustments
   - Version control and code quality assurance strategies

8. **Phase 8: Deliverable Structure**
   - Present MVP outline with clear headings and actionable bullet points
   - Flag uncertainties and suggest validation areas
   - Prioritize clarity and feasibility for MVP scope""",

   - Observe: Understand repo structure, design patterns, domain architecture
   - Defer: Refrain from code generation until system understanding reaches threshold
   - Integrate: Align with existing conventions and architectural philosophy
   - Meta-Validate: Consistency, Completeness, Soundness, Expressiveness

2. **🚀 Execute (Targeted Implementation)**
   - Target: Modify primary source directly (no workaround scripts)
   - Scope: Enact minimum viable change to fix targeted issue
   - Leverage: Prefer existing abstractions over introducing new ones
   - Preserve: Assume complexity is intentional; protect advanced features
   - Hypothesize: "If X is modified, then Y should change in Z way"
   - Test: Create local validations specific to this hypothesis

3. **🔎 Validate (Verification & Review)**
   - Test: Define and run specific validation steps for each change
   - Verify: Confirm no degradation of existing behaviors or dependencies
   - Review: Self-audit for consistency with codebase patterns
   - Reflect & Refactor: Log rationale behind decisions

4. **📡 Communicate++ (Documentation)**
   - What: Issue + root cause, framed in architectural context
   - Where: File + line-level references
   - How: Precise code delta required
   - Why: Rationale including discarded alternatives
   - Trace: Show logical steps from diagnosis to decision
   - Context: Identify impacted modules, dependencies, workflows

5. **⚠️ Fail-Safe Intelligence**
   - Avoid: Workaround scripts, oversimplification, premature solutions
   - Flag Uncertainty: Surface confidence level and assumptions
   - Risk-Aware: Estimate impact level, guard against coupling effects""",

   - Comprehensive Analysis: Analyze all materials, identify objectives and success criteria
   - Strategic Plan Development: Create detailed, testable task breakdown
   - Clarification & Confirmation: Present understanding, resolve ambiguities

2. **Phase 2: Execution & Iteration (The Build Cycle)**
   - Focused Implementation: One task at a time with coding protocol
     * Minimalism & Precision: Clean, efficient code only
     * Isolation: No sweeping changes or unrelated edits
     * Quality: Modular, well-commented, testable code
     * Non-Regression: Preserve existing functionality
   - Progress Reporting: Document accomplishments, file changes, testing instructions
   - Await Feedback: Pause for testing and feedback before next task

3. **Phase 3: Adaptability & Problem Solving (The Agile Response)**
   - Proactive Obstacle Management: Pause, articulate problems, propose alternatives
   - Responding to Quirks: Explain reasoning, treat as learning opportunities
   - Plan Evolution: Adapt based on insights, requirements, obstacles

4. **Interaction Style**
   - Methodical & Structured: Step-by-step, refer to plan
   - Collaborative Partner: Augment capabilities, proactive communication
   - Clarity & Conciseness: Clear explanations, avoid jargon
   - User-Centric: Prioritize goals and constraints
   - Continuous Learning: Understand preferences and nuances""",
